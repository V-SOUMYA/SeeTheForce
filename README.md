# SeeTheForce
### From Equation to Motion

**SeeTheForce** is an AI-powered physics visualization tool that transforms classical physics problems into clear, educational animations.  
It helps learners bridge the gap between mathematical equations and physical intuition.

---

## 🚀 What it does

- Converts physics questions into animated motion using **Gemini**
- Shows **physical motion** and **mathematical graphs** side by side
- Focuses on clarity and intuition, not just computation

Supported concepts include:
- Kinematics (1D & 2D motion, free fall, projectile motion)
- Uniform acceleration & braking
- Graph-based motion (position vs time, velocity vs time)
- Introductory Newtonian mechanics (simplified)

---

## 🧠 How it works

1. A user enters a classical physics question
2. Gemini analyzes the problem and generates structured motion data
3. The frontend renders:
   - **Physical motion** (object moving in space)
   - **Mathematical representation** (graph with labeled axes)
4. Both views update in sync — showing the same physics in two forms

This is what we mean by **From Equation to Motion**.
